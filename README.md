A simple tool that converts text into binary format &amp; hides them as spaces


Tools used : MATLAB,
this converts a given text into a binary format & hides the text in the spaces of the carrierText.txt file ( senseless message).
the unhide function can be used to retrieve the data that has been hidden, longer output are automatically written into a text file.

If possible we need to make a carrierText msg generator.
